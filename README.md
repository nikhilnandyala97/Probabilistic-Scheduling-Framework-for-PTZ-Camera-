# Probabilistic-Scheduling-Framework-for-PTZ-Camera-
Probabilistic Scheduling of Motion of PTZ Camera using Semantic Observations  like Human, Face etc. PTZ camera has many different views i.e states, using Learning Algorithms of we schedule the motion of the camera among states such that it covers maximum anamoly. Read the report to understand the framework/application. Use Installation.pdf to install the librabies required and read explaining the code to unerstand the code.
